# Vault-door-3

## Description
This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor3.java

## Solution
- Looking at the code, the given key is derived from the flag. We need to get the flag from "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41".

- The code is relatively simply, to get back the flag just to do the same loops but in reverse.
- Did the decoder in python
