# GDB baby step 1

## Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

## Solution
- Start gdb then dissasemble main, notice  0x86342 is copied to eax which is 549698 in decimal.
```bash
(gdb) disassemble main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

End of assembler dump.
(gdb) p 0x86342
$1 = 549698
```
> FLAG: picoCTF{549698}
