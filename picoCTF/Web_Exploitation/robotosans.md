# Roboto Sans

## Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

## Solution
- Roboto might indicate robots.txt which I have seen in earlier challenges.

- There's some enrypted text, the padding could imply base64.
```bash
crypto@crypto:~$ echo ZmxhZzEudHh0 | base64 -d
flag1.txt
crypto@crypto:~$ echo anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA== | base64 -d
js/myfile.txt
```
- Went to /flag1.txt gave an error, went to path with /js/myfile.txt/ and got the flag.
