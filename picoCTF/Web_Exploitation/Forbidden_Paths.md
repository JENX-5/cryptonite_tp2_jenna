# Forbidden Paths
## Description
Description
Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths.
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?


## Solution
- As the question stated we need to use relative path to get the flag. They have also mentioned the location of the website and the location of the flag .
- Since absolute paths don't work we need to use relative paths.
- './' represents current directory and '../' is parent directory. We need to move 4 folders up, so '../../' reaches the /usr/share folder.
- We need to move two more folders up so '../../../../' will take us to the root folder /. From there we need to access the flag.txt file.
- Therefore the final path is '../../../../flag.txt'.

- Tried a few relative paths initially but failed. So learnt a bit on relative paths and after figuring it out, the rest was quite simple.
