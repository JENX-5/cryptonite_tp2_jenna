# HideToSee

## Description
How about some hide and seek heh? Look at this image here.

## Solution
![atbash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42143a24-7477-4007-9753-95558179ba61)
- Tried exiftool, checked the hexdata and strings but nothing useful. Now the hint was to extract it, maybe theres another image or file embedded in it.

- The passphrase wasn't given but it didn't have one just simply click enter.

Now we need to decrypt the data, since the picture was atbash I tried online atbash decoder.
