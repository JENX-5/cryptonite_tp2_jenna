# C3
## Description
 This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher! Download the ciphertext here. Download the encoder here. 
 Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission.
 If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}". 

 ## Solution
- The encoder is written in python.(Know python already)
- So lets look at the code.

- Logic for Decoder: 
    - If we see the encoder, it uses the index of the character in the string lookup1, then stores in cur.
    - Next it finds the character in lookup2 at index:- (cur - prev)%40 to get the encoded text.
    - Now to decode it, we find the index of the character(in the cipher text) in lookup2 ,( lookup2.index(x) ), and store it in a variable c.
    - To find the value of cur, since cur is the index of the actual character in lookup1.
    - The value c is (curr-prev)%40 , so cur = c + prev (ignore %40). Now find lookup1[cur%40] which will give us the character at that index, mod40 incase cur is greater than 40 to keep index in range.
    - The value of prev should change to cur before the next iteration.
    -  Lets test the decoder.

- Just for testing whether decoder works, I gave an input first,  encoded it using the given encoder
   then used the value in my decoder to check whether it working.
- Ignore the numbers, I was just checking the value stored in the variables.
- Since I managed to successfully decode it with my given input. Lets decode the given cipher text.

- Hmm, the decoded text is another python program. Stored the decoded text in a file.
- The code is written in python2, didn't have to change the code much for it to work, just added parentheses to the print statement.
- Not sure if the program is a decoder or encoder, but let's try it as a decoder first.
- The input is not mentioned, so let's use the last decoded value(also the program) which I earlier stored in a file as input.
- The code just prints the characters at index of cubes i.e. 1^3,2^3,3^3 ...
- Run the code, got the following output

- Wasn't really expecting it as a flag but lets try, putting in the flag format picoCTF{adlibs} and it is correct.

> Flag: picoCTF{adlibs}
